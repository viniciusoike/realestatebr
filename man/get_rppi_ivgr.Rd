Imports the IVG-R sales index
}
\details{
The IVG-R, or Residential Real Estate Collateral Value Index, is a monthly median
sales index based on bank appraisals in Brazil. The index is calculated by the
Brazilian Central Bank and is representative of the entire country. The index estimates
the long-run trend in home prices and encompasses Brazil's major metropolitan regions.
Trend in prices are obtained by the familiar Hodrick-Prescott filter (lambda = 3600)
applied to each city. The IVG-R is a weighted average of these price trends.

Median property price indices suffer from composition bias and cannot account
for quality changes across the housing stock.
