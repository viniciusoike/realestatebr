\title{Get the IVGR Sales Index}
\usage{
get_rppi_ivgr(cached = FALSE, quiet = FALSE, max_retries = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{cached}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, attempts to load data from package cache
using the unified dataset architecture.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppresses progress messages and warnings.
If \code{FALSE} (default), provides detailed progress reporting.}

\item{max_retries}{Integer. Maximum number of retry attempts for failed
BCB API calls. Defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with the IVGR Index where:
\itemize{
\item \code{index} is the index-number.
\item \code{chg} is the monthly change.
\item \code{acum12m} is the year-on-year change.
}

The tibble includes metadata attributes:
\describe{
\item{download_info}{List with download statistics}
\item{source}{Data source used (api or cache)}
\item{download_time}{Timestamp of download}
}
}
\description{
Imports the IVG-R sales index with modern error handling, progress reporting,
and robust BCB API access capabilities.
}
\details{
The IVG-R, or Residential Real Estate Collateral Value Index, is a monthly median
sales index based on bank appraisals in Brazil. The index is calculated by the
Brazilian Central Bank and is representative of the entire country. The index estimates
the long-run trend in home prices and encompasses Brazil's major metropolitan regions.
Trend in prices are obtained by the familiar Hodrick-Prescott filter (lambda = 3600)
applied to each city. The IVG-R is a weighted average of these price trends.

Median property price indices suffer from composition bias and cannot account
for quality changes across the housing stock.

\section{Progress Reporting}{

When \code{quiet = FALSE}, the function provides detailed progress information
including BCB API access status and data processing steps.
}

\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes retry logic for failed BCB API calls and robust
error handling for data processing operations.

\dontrun{
# Get IVGR index (with progress)
ivgr <- get_rppi_ivgr(quiet = FALSE)

# Use cached data for faster access
cached_data <- get_rppi_ivgr(cached = TRUE)

# Check download metadata
