\details{
The IQA, or QuintoAndar Rental Index, is a median stratified index calculated
for Brazil's two main cities: Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Median property
price indices suffer from composition bias and cannot account for quality
changes across the housing stock. The source of the data are all the monthly
rent contracts managed by QuintoAndar. The Index includes only apartments and
similar units such as studios and flats.

Despite the name "Index", the IQA provides a raw-price and not an index-number.
This means that the \code{rent_price} column is the median rent per square meter.
