\details{
The FipeZap Index is a monthly median stratified index calculated across several
cities in Brazil. This function imports both the rental and the sale index for
all cities. The Index is based on online listings of the Zap Imóveis group and is
stratified by number of rooms. The overall city index is a weighted sum of median
prices by room/region.

The residential Index includes only apartments and similar units such as studios and flats.
