\title{Get the FipeZap RPPI}
\usage{
get_rppi_fipezap(city = "all", cached = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{city}{Either the name of the city or \code{'all'} (default). If the chosen
city name is not available the full table will be returned.}

\item{cached}{If \code{TRUE} downloads the cached data from the GitHub repository.
This is a faster option but not recommended for daily data.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with RPPI data for all selected cities where:
\itemize{
\item \code{market} - specifices either \code{'commercial'} or \code{'residential'}
\item \code{rent_sale} - specifies either \code{'rent'} or \code{'sale'}
\item \code{variable} - 'index' is the index-number, 'chg' is the monthly change, 'acum12m' is the year-on-year change, 'price_m2' is the raw sale/rent price per squared meter, and 'yield' is the gross rental yield.
\item \code{rooms} - number of rooms (\code{total} is the average)
}

The national index is defined as the series with \code{name_muni == 'Índice Fipezap+'}.
}
\description{
Import residential and commercial prices indices from FipeZap
}
\details{
The FipeZap Index is a monthly median stratified index calculated across several
cities in Brazil. This function imports both the rental and the sale index for
all cities. The Index is based on online listings of the Zap Imóveis group and is
stratified by number of rooms. The overall city index is a weighted sum of median
prices by room/region.

The residential Index includes only apartments and similar units such as studios and flats.

Choosing a specific city will only filter the final results and will not save
processing/downloading time.
