\description{
Downloads data from the Abrainc-Fipe Indicators report. Data includes
information on new launches, sales, delivered units, etc. in the primary
market.
}
\details{
The data in \code{'indicator'} gives broad numbers of launches, sales, supply, etc.
of new housing units in the primary sector.

The data in \code{'radar'} is a 0-10 standardized index that serves as a proxy
for general business conditions.

The data in \code{'leading'} compiles building permits data in Sao Paulo and uses
this information as proxy for a real estate leading indicator.

Units indicated as \code{"Social Housing (MCMV)"} are units related either to the
Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV) or Casa Verde Amarela (CVA) federal government
housing programs. These programs aim to provide affordable housing for low to
medium income families. While the eligible families enjoy subsidized credit
conditions the housing is not free (families commit to monthly mortgage payments)
and is usually built by private developers. The definition of social housing
varies by country so caution is advised in making international comparisons.

Data comes from developers that are partnered with Abrainc. As of June 2023, there were
66 real estate developers associated with Abrainc.
