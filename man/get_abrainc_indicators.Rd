get_abrainc_indicators(
  table = "indicator",
  cached = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  max_retries = 3L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{Character. One of \code{'indicator'} (default), \code{'radar'}, \code{'leading'}, or \code{'all'}.}

\item{cached}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, attempts to load data from package cache
using the unified dataset architecture.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppresses progress messages and warnings.
If \code{FALSE} (default), provides detailed progress reporting.}

\item{max_retries}{Integer. Maximum number of retry attempts for failed
downloads. Defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
Either a named \code{list} (when table is \code{'all'}) or a \code{tibble}
(for specific tables). The return includes metadata attributes:
\describe{
\item{download_info}{List with download statistics}
\item{source}{Data source used (web or cache)}
\item{download_time}{Timestamp of download}
}
}
\description{
Import Indicators from the Abrainc-Fipe Report
}
\details{
The data in \code{'indicator'} gives broad numbers of launches, sales, supply, etc.
of new housing units in the primary sector.

The data in \code{'radar'} is a 0-10 standardized index that serves as a proxy
for general business conditions.

The data in \code{'leading'} compiles building permits data in Sao Paulo and uses
this information as proxy for a real estate leading indicator.

Units indicated as \code{"Social Housing (MCMV)"} are units related either to the
Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV) or Casa Verde Amarela (CVA) federal government
housing programs. These programs aim to provide affordable housing for low to
medium income families. While the eligible families enjoy subsidized credit
conditions the housing is not free (families commit to monthly mortgage payments)
and is usually built by private developers. The definition of social housing
varies by country so caution is advised in making international comparisons.

Data comes from developers that are partnered with Abrainc. As of June 2023, there were
66 real estate developers associated with Abrainc.

\section{Deprecation}{

This function is deprecated. Use \code{\link{get_dataset}("abrainc_indicators")} instead.

Downloads data from the Abrainc-Fipe Indicators report with modern error
handling, progress reporting, and robust download capabilities. Data includes
information on new launches, sales, delivered units, etc. in the primary
market.
}

\section{Progress Reporting}{

When \code{quiet = FALSE}, the function provides detailed progress information
including download status and data processing steps.
}

\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes retry logic for failed downloads and graceful fallback
to cached data when downloads fail. Excel download errors are handled with
automatic retries and informative error messages.

\dontrun{
# Get all available data (with progress)

# Get only the Radar data
radar <- get_abrainc_indicators(table = "radar")

# Use cached data for faster access
cached_data <- get_abrainc_indicators(cached = TRUE)

# Check download metadata
