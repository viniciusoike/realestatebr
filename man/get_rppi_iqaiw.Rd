Get QuintoAndar ImovelWeb Rental Index (IQAIW)
}
\details{
The IQAIW (√çndice QuintoAndar ImovelWeb) is a rental index for major Brazilian
cities. The index is based on both new rental contracts (managed by QuintoAndar)
and online listings from QuintoAndar's listings (including ImovelWeb).
The IQAIW was develoepd in 2023 and replaced the former IQA index. Given the
change in methodology and data sources, the IQAIW is not directly comparable to
the IQA index.
Formally, the index is a hedonic double imputed index, controlling for quality
changes using a flexible GAM specification with location variables. In this
sense, the IQAIW is more theoretically sound than median stratified indices
like FipeZap or the former IQA. The mixture of listings and contracts, however,
lacks theoretical support and seems to be mainly driven by branding purposes.
The ImovelWeb brand was purchased by QuintoAndar in 2021-22 and the IQAIW
symbolizes the merging of both brands. In other words, the original IQA could've
been improved simply by adopting a hedonic methodology, without the need to
mix data sources.
