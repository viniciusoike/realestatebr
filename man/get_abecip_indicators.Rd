\description{
Downloads updated housing credit data from Abecip. Abecip represents the major
financial institutions that integrate Brazil's finance housing system (SFH).
}
\details{
This function returns three tables:
\enumerate{
\item The \code{sbpe} table summarizes the monetary flows from SBPE. Values are nominal
and currency changes over the years. Data is available since January 1982. Original
data from Abecip is split into rural (\code{rural_} and non-rural (\code{sbpe_}). The total
columns sum rural and non-rural financing.
\item The \code{units} table summarizes the number of units financed by SBPE. Data
is available since January 2002. The original data discriminates loans that
are used to finance new units (\verb{_construction}) and to finance acquisitions in
the secondary market (\verb{_acquisition}). The \code{units_} columns are in absolute units.
The \code{currency_} columns are in millions of nominal BRL (R$ million).
\item The \code{cgi} table returns summary data on home-equity loans. Data is available
since January 2017. All columns are in absolute/nominal units except \code{default_rate} which
is in percentage and \code{average_term} which is in months.
