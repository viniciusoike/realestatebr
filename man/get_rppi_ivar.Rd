\title{Get the IVAR rent Index}
\usage{
get_rppi_ivar(cached = FALSE, quiet = FALSE, max_retries = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{cached}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, attempts to load data from package cache
using the unified dataset architecture.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppresses progress messages and warnings.
If \code{FALSE} (default), provides detailed progress reporting.}

\item{max_retries}{Integer. Maximum number of retry attempts for failed
data processing operations. Defaults to 3.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} stacking data for all cities. The national IVAR is defined
as the series with \code{name_muni == 'Brazil'}.
\itemize{
\item \code{index} is the index-number.
\item \code{chg} is the monthly change.
\item \code{acum12m} is the year-on-year change.
}

The tibble includes metadata attributes:
\describe{
\item{download_info}{List with download statistics}
\item{source}{Data source used (web or cache)}
\item{download_time}{Timestamp of download}
}
}
\description{
Imports the IVAR rent index for all cities available with modern
error handling, progress reporting, and robust data processing capabilities.
}
\details{
The IVAR, or Residential Rent Variation Index, is a repeat-rent index, meaning
it compares the same housing unit across different points in time. The source
of the Index are rental contracts provided by brokers to IBRE (FGV). Data is available
in four major Brazilian cities; the national index is calculated as a weighted
average of the four individual series.

Although other price indices such as the IGP-M are commonly used in rental
contracts in Brazil, the IVAR is theoretically more appropriate since it
measures only rent prices.

\section{Progress Reporting}{

When \code{quiet = FALSE}, the function provides detailed progress information
including data processing and calculation steps.
}

\section{Error Handling}{

The function includes robust error handling for data processing operations
and validation of required data dependencies.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get the IVAR index (with progress)
ivar <- get_rppi_ivar(quiet = FALSE)

# Subset national index
brasil <- subset(ivar, name_muni == "Brazil")

# Use cached data for faster access
cached_data <- get_rppi_ivar(cached = TRUE)

# Check download metadata
attr(ivar, "download_info")
