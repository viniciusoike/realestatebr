\title{Get the IVAR rent Index}
\usage{
get_rppi_ivar(cached = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cached}{If \code{TRUE} downloads the cached data from the GitHub repository.
This is a faster option but not recommended for daily data.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} stacking data for all cities. The national IVAR is defined
as the series with \code{name_muni = 'Brazil'}.
}
\description{
The IVAR Index is a monthly repeat-rent index and is based on rental contracts
in four major Brazilian cities. The national index is calculated as a weighted
average of the four individual series.
}
\details{
The IVAR, or Residential Rent Variation Index, is a repeat-rent index, meaning
it compares the same housing unit across different points in time. The source
of the Index are rental contracts provided by brokers to IBRE (FGV).

Although other price indices such as the IGP-M are commonly used in rental
contracts in Brazil, the IVAR is theoretically more appropriate since it
measures only rent prices.
